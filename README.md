## Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy
I'm a Software Developer/Machine Learning Engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook), London, UK since January 2021. I work on production related projects relevant to recommender systems, ranking and information retrieval. 

Previously, I was a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) in between February 2019-January 2021. My research interests were recommender systems, machine learning, information retrieval and text mining. I mainly focused on 
(i) Making explainable and novel recommendations in heterogeneous information networks and 
(ii) Application of reinforcement learning methods to recommender systems.
