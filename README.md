Iâ€™m a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) since February 2019. My research interests are recommender systems, machine learning, information retrieval and text mining. 

Nowadays, I work on two main topics related to recommender systems:  
(i) Making explainable and novel recommendations in heterogeneous information networks.  
(ii) Application of reinforcement learning methods to recommender systems.
