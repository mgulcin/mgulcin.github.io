I am a Software Developer & Machine Learning Engineer at Neo4j, working on LLM-based solutions for database interactions. My expertise includes recommender systems, ranking, and information retrieval.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook) in London, focusing on ranking and recommendation for an e-commerce platform.

I hold a BSc, MSc, and PhD in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University (METU), Turkey, with a research visit at the University of Calgary, Canada during my PhD.

My work revolves around AI-driven systems that enhance search, retrieval, and data interaction.
