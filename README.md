I’m a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) since February 2019. My research interests are recommender systems, machine learning, information retrieval and text mining. 

Nowadays I’m working on reinforcement learning-based recommender systems.
