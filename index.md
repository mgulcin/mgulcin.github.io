I'm a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) since February 2019.

My research interests are recommender systems, machine learning and information retrieval.
Nowadays, I work on two main topics related to recommender systems:<br/>
(i) Making explainable and novel recommendations in heterogeneous information networks.<br/>
(ii) Application of reinforcement learning methods to recommender systems.


I got my BSc degree in 2008, MSc degree in 2011 and PhD degree in 2016, all from Department of Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU) (Ankara, Turkey). 
I was a visiting student at University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) between October 2014 and August 2015.
