I'm a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) since February 2019.

My research interests are recommender systems, machine learning, information retrieval and text mining. 
Nowadays I'm working on reinforcement learning-based recommender systems.


I got my BSc degree in 2008, MSc degree in 2011 and PhD degree in 2016, all from Department of Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU) (Ankara, Turkey). 
I was a visiting student at University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) in October 2014 - August 2015.
