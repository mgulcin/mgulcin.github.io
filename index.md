I'm a Software Developer/Machine Learning Engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook), London, UK since January 2021. I work on production related projects relevant to recommender systems, ranking and information retrieval.

Previously, I was a PostDoctoral Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin (UCD) (Dublin, Ireland) in between February 2019-January 2021. My research interests were recommender systems, machine learning and information retrieval. I mainly focused on <br/>
(i) Making explainable and novel recommendations in heterogeneous information networks and <br/>
(ii) Application of reinforcement learning methods to recommender systems.


I got my BSc degree in 2008, MSc degree in 2011 and PhD degree in 2016, all from Department of Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU) (Ankara, Turkey). 
I was a visiting student at University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) between October 2014 and August 2015.
