I'm a Software Developer/Machine Learning Engineer, mainly working on recommender systems, ranking and information retrieval.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook), London, UK (Jan'21-Aug'23). I mainly worked on a project where I designed solutions for ranking and recommendation for an eâ€‘commerce platform.
 
 
I got my BSc degree in 2008, MSc degree in 2011 and PhD degree in 2016, all from Department of Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU) (Ankara, Turkey). 
I was a visiting student at University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) between October 2014 and August 2015.
